# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview
This is a FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python project - a Rock Paper Scissors game that implements AI strategies to defeat various bot opponents. The goal is to create a player function that can win at least 60% of games against four different AI bots (quincy, abbey, kris, and mrugesh).

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for testing the player function against bots
- `RPS.py`: Contains the player function that needs to be implemented
- `RPS_game.py`: Game engine and bot implementations (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `test_module.py`: Unit tests to validate the player performance

## Current State
- Python 3.11 environment set up and working
- Workflow configured to run the console application
- All code runs without errors
- The `player` function currently returns empty strings (placeholder implementation)
- Ready for AI strategy development

## User Preferences
- This is a console-based Python project (no frontend)
- Code should follow the existing structure and not modify RPS_game.py
- Focus on implementing winning strategies in the player function

## Architecture
- Language: Python 3.11
- Type: Console application
- Testing: Unit tests with win rate requirements (â‰¥60% against each bot)
- Workflow: Runs `python main.py` to test all bot matchups

## Recent Changes
- 2025-09-20: Initial project setup in Replit environment
- Installed Python 3.11 with full toolchain
- Configured workflow for console output
- Verified all components working correctly
